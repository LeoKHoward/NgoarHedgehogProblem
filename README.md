# Hedgehog Problem

A simple Java application used to calculate maximum number of apples a hedgehog can achieve.

# Overview

Starting from top left square of the garden (0,0) and finishing at the bottom right square of garden (m-1, n-1).

The hedgehog can only move right one square or down one square.

# How to use

The top two numbers of the Input.txt will be M and N which dictate the size of the garden by how many rows and columns
there are.

The next lines are the number of apples in each square of the garden.

This will then produce the result from Output.txt for the maximum possible number of apples the hedgehog can get.

```
Input.txt:
3 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3


Output.txt:
12
```
